## 🧠 Key Projects

### 🔧 [Wind Turbine Failure Detection](projects/wind-turbine-failure/)
Neural network built to detect early signs of mechanical failure in wind turbines. Features:
- Imbalanced classification strategies (threshold tuning & class weighting)
- High-recall model optimization and cost analysis
- Real-world application in preventive maintenance

### 🏦 [Personal Loan Conversion Prediction – AllLife Bank](projects/personal-loan-prediction/)
Decision tree classification model to support targeted marketing:
- Compares pre-pruning and post-pruning strategies  
- Post-pruned tree highlighted income, CCAvg, family size, and education as key predictors  
- Post-pruning reduced false positives by 30% while maintaining high accuracy  
- Business recommendation: focus campaigns on high-income, high-spending, graduate-educated segments with families ≥ 3  
- Suggests F1-optimized models for better recall–precision balance if misclassification risk rises
