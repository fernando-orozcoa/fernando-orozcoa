## üßæ Project Summary

Analyzed customer ordering behavior, restaurant performance, and delivery operations using FoodHub‚Äôs NYC-based order dataset. The goal was to generate business-oriented insights to improve customer satisfaction, optimize delivery logistics, and boost revenue from high-margin orders. The project highlights end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python, revealing patterns in cuisine demand, rating dynamics, and operational efficiency.

## üîç Business Case

FoodHub, a food aggregator platform, wanted to leverage its historical order data to enhance app performance, streamline delivery, and identify key restaurant and cuisine trends. As a Data Scientist, I was tasked with answering critical business questions to guide product strategy, marketing, and operations.

## üí° Key Findings

- **Customer Behavior**:  
  - 71% of orders were placed on weekends, signaling time-based promotional opportunities.  
  - 65% of customers placed only a single order‚Äîindicating a major opportunity for retention initiatives.

- **Cuisine & Restaurant Trends**:  
  - American (31%), Japanese (25%), and Italian (16%) were the most popular cuisines.  
  - Shake Shack was the top performer by volume and revenue.  

- **Customer Ratings**:  
  - 39% of orders lacked a rating‚Äîlimiting feedback channels.  
  - Higher-cost orders tended to earn better ratings (5-star orders averaged ~$17).  
  - 4-star orders had the lowest delivery times, suggesting quick delivery improves satisfaction.

- **Delivery Performance**:  
  - Weekend deliveries were ~6 minutes faster than weekday deliveries (22.5 vs 28.3 min).  
  - Delivery times showed moderate correlation with ratings and should be optimized further.

- **Revenue Insights**:  
  - Total net revenue: **$6,166.30**  
  - Orders over $20 made up 29% of the total but drove disproportionately high profit.

## üß≠ Strategic Recommendations

1. **Boost Rating Collection**  
   - Add post-delivery reminders or incentives for customer reviews.  

2. **Promote Undervalued Restaurants**  
   - Bundle them with popular cuisine promos or offer ‚Äúfirst try‚Äù discounts.  

3. **Develop a Loyalty Program**  
   - Offer discounts on second orders, push notifications for new items, and reward repeat buyers.

4. **Improve Delivery Operations**  
   - Strengthen weekday delivery logistics and ensure adequate staffing during high-volume weekends.

5. **Maximize Revenue Through Upsells**  
   - Create combo deals to nudge basket value past the $20 threshold and promote high-margin add-ons.
